                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Seetha Amman Temple in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, is a significant site within the Ramayana trail, believed to be the location where Sita was held captive by Ravana. The temple was built in the early 2000s, but the area is thought to have been sacred long before, with the discovery of three idols in a nearby stream, including one potentially depicting Sita. The stream itself is believed to be where Sita bathed, and a nearby rock is said to be where she prayed. The temple is situated in Seetha Eliya, a location believed to be the Ashok Vatika (garden) where Sita was held by Ravana. The area is thought to have been a place of worship for a long time, as evidenced by the discovery of idols. The stream is believed to be where Sita bathed, and a nearby rock is said to be where she prayed. Some devotees believe that Hanuman, the monkey god, left footprints on a rock nearby while searching for Sita. The temple itself was built in the early 2000s, but the site's historical and religious significance predates its construction. The temple is a popular destination for both Hindus and tourists, and it plays a significant role in the Ramayana narrative. .</p>

It's likely a newer temple dedicated to a different deity, with its own distinct history. The Sri Lakshmi Narayana Perumal Kovil should not be confused with the Koneswaram Temple, which is an ancient temple complex with a long and significant history. The Koneswaram Temple was the main Hindu shrine in Trincomalee and has a complex history of construction, destruction, and restoration..</p>

The temple is surrounded by gardens and small temples, and you'll see many devotees offering prayers and offerings to the tree.One of the most special things about the Sri Maha Bodhi is the rituals and ceremonies that take place around the tree throughout the day. There is chanting and meditation, offerings and blessings and all kinds of other spiritual activity that you can witness, but please be respectful.As you approach the tree, you'll notice the many prayer flags and offerings that have been left there over the years. And because of its age, the tree needs some support - this is why elaborately carved and gilded support beams have been erected.</p>

After all, this ancient temple dating back to the 3rd century b.c. is considered to be a symbol of the enduring power of love and devotion. How so? The legendary story of Prince Saliya and the low-caste maiden Asokamala, an important piece of Sri Lankan literature, is believed to have taken place here.On a more factual note, the Rock Temple of Anuradhapura is about 2300 years old and thus one of the oldest in Sri Lanka. The temple enshrines several important Buddhist relics, including a statue of the Buddha, as well as ancient carvings and inscriptions that depict important events from the life of the Buddha.This temple should only be a very short stop on your exploration of Anuradhapura, because the area is fairly small with only one sanctuary. You can however climb the stairs to the top of the rock to closer admire the stupa - and to have a good look at the many cave bats.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">This stupa is truly jaw dropping for its majestic size alone. It has a circumference of 951ft (290m) and stands 338ft (103m) tall, making it one of the tallest stupas in the world! But it’s not its size that makes it so important for Buddhists. The Ruwanwelisaya is said to enshrine the largest collection of Buddha relics anywhere in the world.Another impressive feature of the Ruwanwelisaya is the line up of elephant statues all around the temple grounds. The stupa actually stands on a square platform that built to look like it was carried on the back of hundreds of elephants. All around the platform, there is a sand moat with fencing - we were told this is supposed to keep some animals away, while smart and agile beings like snakes can still cross and listen to the sermons.Worship here takes place outside, there are no temple buildings at the Ruwanwelisaya.To get a better idea of its size, watch my short clip below:</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thuparama, also spelt "Thuparamaya", is not a giant stupa but noteworthy as the first stupa in Anuradhapura and, most probably, the oldest one in Sri Lanka. Thuparama is situated at the northern end of the Mahavihara complex. The Mahavihara was the first monastery founded in Sri Lanka officially observing the canonically prescribed rules of consecration. Soon after, the Sinhalese king sent an envoy, Sumara, to Emperor Ashoka asking him for relics as a gift. He got the right collarbone of the Buddha, which was enshrined in the newly erected first stupa of the Sinhalese kingdom. It fell into decay several times, but was restored again and again. During the reign of King Aggabodhi II in the 7th century, 2 circular rows of columns were added to carry a roof, altering Thuparama to a Chetiyaghara, a "Stupa-House." Today's white dome is the result of a restaurationdone in 1862.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The best preserved original stupa architecture of Sri Lanka can be seen in Mihintale. The Kantaka Chetiya is one of the first stupas erected in Sri Lanka, presumably already in the 3rd century B.C.E., when Buddhism was introduced in the Sinhalese kingdom. Epigraphic evidence attributes a restoration of this stupa to King Lanja Tissa (Lajitissa), who reigned from 119 till 109 B.C.E. The lower levels of the Kantaka Chetiya are in such a good state of preservation due to the fact that this stupa had been covered by soil for centuried, before it was excavated in 1934. It’s 12 m high now. Originally, the dome had a height of 30 m. The diameter is 41 m. The most remarkable feature are the four frontispieces. Such Vahalkadas placed in front of the dome at the cardinal points are typical for Sinhalese stupas. They are elaborately sculptured with earliest examples of Gana dwarfs in different actions and with animals.</p>

Mirisaveti was the first giant stupa erected in Sri Lanka and the first major construction project of the Sinhalese national hero, King Duttha Gamani (Dutugemunu), who defeated the Tamil King Elara, who had previously ruled in Anuradhapura, When Dutthagamani took a bath in the nearby reservoir called Tissawewa, he left his weapon, the royal lance, behind him. The lance was a sacred weapon. The Buddhist Sangha had once encouraged Dutthagamani to free Anuradhapura from non-Buddhist rule and endowed an original Buddha relic, which was kept in the royal lance. When Dutthagamni now came back from his bath, he found himself unable to move the lance from the place, where he had left it. So he understood: This was the place the relic had chosen to be buried under a giant stupa. </P>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Abhayagiri Dagoba is the centre of the monastery of the same name in Anuradhapura. It was founded by King Vattagamani Abhaya, known as Valagamba in Sinhala, one of the island's most significant Buddhist kings.  The Abhayagiri Dagoba surpassed the giant stupa of the rivalling Mahavihara monastery, Ruwanweliseya. The diameter of the Abhayagiri stupa is 150 m, total height is 115 m. Abhayagiri Vihara is the largest ancient monastic complex in Sri Lanka and a focal point of the UNESCO sponsored excavation and development project called "Cultural Triangle". The Abhagiri monastery welcomed Mahayanist traditions and was a pioneer in the development of the island's art. The decorations at the four frontispieces (Vahalkadas) of this giant stupa are regarded as the best examples of this typical sculptural decoration, besides those at the Kantaka Chetiya in Mihintale.  </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">As already mentioned, the Jetavanarama Dagoba is the largest ancient stupa dome at all. It was scientifically restored in the beginning of our century. The giant stupa forms the centrepiece of the systematically planned Jetavanarama monastery. This monastery is a result of a shism of the Mahavihara monastery. Indeed, the Jetavanarama stupa is erected on former temple land of the Mahavihara. Using the consecrated area for other projects without the consent of the monastery is actually a sacrilege in Buddhism. King Mahasena, who promoted the newly established Jetavanarama monastery at the end of the 3rd century C.E., is therefore considered as a heretic in the ancient chronicles. Nevertheless, the Jetavanarama remained to be one of the three major Buddhist orders of the Sinhalese island nation in the subsequent seven centuries of the Anuradhapura period.  </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, the Demala Mahaseya might derive its name from the term “Demahal”. which can mean "two-storey". The large dagoba was flat, compared to the almost hemispherical domes of the much earlier giant stupas in Anuradhapura. But this is probably the result of a new form of stupas developed in the Polonnaruwa period, particularly during the reign of King Parakramabahu I. This form is "two-storey" indeed. The wide dome is cut in height, but in the centre of the elevated platform atop this wide lower dome is a second stupa of a much smaller diameter, forming the second storey of the entire stupa building. This new form of giant stupas cannot be recognized easily at the overgrown Demala Mahaseya, but it is nevertheless present in Polonnaruwa, only on a smaller scale.  The Pabulu Vehera close to the centre of Sri Lanka's medieval capital shows this unusual "two-storey" form. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Though a new form of stupas emerged in this period, there is nevertheless an example of the classic hemispherical style of Sinhalese stupas in Polonnaruwa, too. Though not as huge as the three largest dagobas of Anuradhapura, the Rankot Vehera near Polonnaruwa's main monastic complex, Alahena Pirivena, is still of an impressive size. The Rankot Vehera is the landmark giant stupa of Polonnaruwa. It was constructed in the late 12th century by King Nissanka Malla, who was eager to surpass his predecessors in Polonnaruwa, at least in quantities of inscriptions, donations and building activities. Not only the form resembles that of Anuradhapura's giant stupas. In fact, a stone inscription situated close to the stupa identifies it by the name "Ruwanweli".  The diameter at the base is  slightly more than 60 m, the total height is 55 m. The name "Rankot" means "golden pinnacle". </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Dedigama in the western foothills of Sri Lanka's central highlands  is the birthplace of King Parakramabahu the Great. The chronicles mention that he erected a giant stupa at the location of the house in which he was born. It is quite sure, that this stupa is that of Dedigama. The 78 m wide giant stupa  is also known as "Kotavehera". Literally, this means "short stupa". It may refer to the shape of this stupa. It seems to be cut at half of a dome's height. It is not entirely clear, whether the Dedigama stupa remained unfinished or if this was intentionally chosen, corresponding with the new type of stupas developed in Polonnaruwa. Though rarely visited, Dedigama is an exciting stupa, because the relic chambers were untouched. The excavation was one of the most fascinating in Sri Lankas archaeology. Many of the findings, some of them golden or gilded statues, are exhibeted in a museum just 100 m away from the stupa.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Yudaganawa dagoba is the largest stupa in southern Sri Lanka. It is said to be at the site of a battle between Dutthagamani and his brother in a war of succession. This battle took place in the 2nd century B.C.E. It is possible that a first stupa was built here during Anuradhapura period. But is highly unlikely that the stupa which can be seen today is from this early period. There are many different datings. But most probably the giant stupa in Yudaganawa, 95 m wide and in the "two-story" shape, is from the reign of Parakramabahu I, the famous Polonnaruwa king. Like Dedigama marks his father's hometown, Yudaganawa is believed to be his mother's hometown. Erecting stupas in Polonnaruwa and in the west in Dedigama and in the south in Yudaganawa symbolizes the unification of all parts of the island under Parakramabahu, Rajarata, Dakkhinadesa und Rohana respectively.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Digavapi is the only giant stupa in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. The diameter at the base is about 90 m. This is all the more impressive as it could have been a full-sized dome. In this case, the Digavapi stupa would have been much bigger than the Yudaganwa stupa. The Digavapi stupa is usually attributed to King Saddha Tissa, Dutthagamani's brother, who had been the local ruler in the east before becoming Dutthagamani's successor in Anuradhapura. In this case, the giant stupa of Digavapi would be drom the same period as the Ruwanweliseya, this is the 2nd century B.C.E. More likely, it was enlarged in later centuries. According to the chronicles, Digavapi is one of the places visited by the Buddha, a so-called "Solosmasthana" site, one od the 16 most sanctified places in Sri Lanka. Since restoration works in the 1920s, Digavapi has become an important pilgrimage site again.</p>

Yala National Park consists of 5 blocks. The most visited area of Yala National Park is Block 1 in the southernmost part of Yala. Leopards can often be observed here sleeping on rock boulders or trees. But Yala block 1 is often crowded with jeeps of day-trippers. Real wildlife enthusiasts will take two or more days to explore the less well-known parts of Yala and to enjoy a moonlight safari, too. Blocks 3, 4 and 5 are situated north of Yala and covered with a thicket of shrubland, offering less observation opportunities. The rarely visited Block 2, stretching along the shore between block 1 and adjacent Yala-East/Kumana National Park has large areas of of open grassland, making block 2 an ideal place to observe wild animals. Entering Yala Block 2 requires special permission. More about Yala.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Kumana National Park is also known as "Yala East". Kumana is Sri Lanka’s national park for birdwatchers in particular. It has the highest number of bird species, The reason for this abundance in birdlife are the many lakes and lagoons of Kumana National Park, the latter being called Kalapuwas. Combinations of small lagoon brack waters and bracky swamps and ancient freshwater tanks are ideal habitats for aquatic birds. Still existing ancient tanks contribute to e abundant birdlife in Kumana. 225 breeding and migratory bird species occur in this Kumana National park. There are more lakes and less rocks in Kumana than in the adjacent Yala National Park, but all in all, the sceneries are quite similar. Because it is much less frequented than Yala, Kumana is still an insider tip for natur lovers. The classical 3-day safari from Yala block 1 is crossing Yala block 2 and to a camp in Kumana.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Lahugala-Kitulana is a very small National Park situated 15 km west of the east coast city Pottuvil.  Lahugala is part of Sri Lanka's southern elephant corridor, crossed by wild elephants when migrating from Yala/Kumana to the large Lake Senanayake in the dry season. Thus northern hemisphere summer months are the best period to visit this national park, then up to 150 individuals gather here, because Lahugala-Kitulana has four natural lakes and plenty of tall Beru grass, which is the elphant's favourite food. Wild elephants can easily be observed at the Mahawewa lake, which is close to mainroad A4, which crosses the entire length of the park. This way, travellers don't need to take part in a safari expedition. Lahugala is also interesting for heritage tourists, as it includes the ancient Magul Maha Vihara. South Sri Lanka's only moonstone rich in details was found here. More about Lahugala.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Udawalawe National Park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild elephants which had been displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe reservoir. Approximately 700 wild elephants live in Udawalawe National Park, on circa 30,000 hectares.  Visitors can see elephants  in small herds of half a dozen or a dozen females and babies and juvenile males. Groups of adult male elephants are smaller, old tuskers are often solitary. Attached to Udawalawe National Park is the Elephant Transit Home, supported by the international "Born Free Foundation". Feeding times are 9 am, 12 noon, 3 pm and 6 pm. This Elephant Orphanage's aim, in contrast to Pinnawela, is to return the elephants to the wild. Besides elephants, 42 other mammal species, 21 fish species, 12 amphibian species and 33 reptile species, 184 bird species and, among other invertebrates, 135 species of butterflies have been recorded in Udawalawe National Park.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Wilpattu Park, situated between Anuradhapura, Puttalam and Mannar, is Sri Lanka's largest national park. The density of leopards and maybe also of sloth bears is even higher than in Yala. Indeed the leopard density in Wilpattu is the highest in the entire world. But to be honest, the chances to sight these amazing animals are slightly lesser than in Yala, because there are not as many open grassland and rock boulders in Wilpattu, compared to Yala. "Wilpattu" is dericed from "Villu", which is the Sinhalese name of small freshwater lakes in depressions collecting surface run-off water. Villus are the characterizing the very core of Wilpattu National Park. They are major feeding grounds for migrating aquatic birds and indispensible waterholes for mammals during the dry season. The best time to visit Wilpattu is from February till August, July is the peak of the "sloth bear observation season".

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Wasgamuwa is a rarely visited national park situated just south of Polonnaruwa. Only few tourists know that herds of wild elephants can be seen at the southern shore of the Polonnaruwa's lake Topa Wewa, with herds of almost equal size as in Minneriya National Park's famous "Elephant Gathering". But the large herds in Wasgamuwa gather in a different season, from November till May.  The elephant herds cannot be seen from Polonnaruwa, but it's possible to observe them on a boat tour starting there. Originally a nature reserve since 1938,  Wasgamuwa was declared national park to offer a refuge for those wild animals that were displaced due to the Mahaweli River development project in 1984. Wasgamuwa is also one of the important bird areas along Sri Lanka's largest river. The name of Wasgamuwa is derived from "Walasa", meaning "sloth bear", and "Gamuwa",  meaning "wood"..</p>
